  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics specializing in energy and environmental economics, with both professional and academic grounding, 
    specializing in energy and environmental policy. 
    I bring experience to the evolving landscape of sustainable transportation, especially to the Electric Vehicle sector. 
    My research focuses on electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior, infrastructure incentives, and demand-side energy management—leveraging high-resolution data and 
    econometric modelling to inform policy and investment decisions.
  <p>  
  <p>
    With over 3 years of experience across Canada, India, and the UK—including roles at CDP and Ford—I’ve contributed to flagship climate reports, 
    assisted in field experiments with major utilities, and collaborated on policy-relevant research with leading economists. 
    My work bridges the gap between data and decision-making, helping shape evidence-based strategies for net-zero transitions. I am actively seeking economist or 
    research-oriented roles in think tanks, public institutions, or policy-focused organizations where I can apply my expertise to drive impactful change in energy systems, 
    climate governance, and infrastructure planning.
  <p>  
  <p>
    Eager to contribute to teams working at the intersection of transportation electrification, data science, and public policy. 
    I’d love to connect if this aligns with your mission and a conversation on clean transportation.
